VK-162 USB GPS Dongle - Remote Mount USB

Caution:  this isn't finished yet, but the goal is a small application
that can read the output of a VK-162 USB GPS dongle and then publish
the GPS coordinates on a ZeroMQ socket.

Why?  Because currently my weatherfxlite application requires you to hardcode
the GPS location in a header file, and I thought well, why not let it update
if it is being fed new coordinates?

So weatherfxlite will be upgraded to listen on ZeroMQ, and if you have the
incredibly expensive GPS Aware addon license installed, you get a location-aware
weather display.  Nifty.  ðŸ™ƒ
